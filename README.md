# Project Compilation Guide

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the files from the `gulp` repository (excluding the `src` folder and `package.json` file) into the project's directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
3. Start the project using Gulp:
   ```sh
   gulp
   ```

This will set up and run the project successfully.
